/**
 * @file ReClassStructs.h
 * @brief Main header that includes all ReClass structure modules
 * 
 * This file serves as the entry point for all ReClass game structure wrappers.
 * The structures have been organized into logical modules for better maintainability:
 * 
 * - AgentStructs.h: Agent and coordinate wrappers for character entities
 * - CharacterStructs.h: Character, health, stats, energies, and player wrappers
 * - GadgetStructs.h: Gadget, agent, and coordinate wrappers for world objects
 * - ContextStructs.h: Context managers and the root context collection
