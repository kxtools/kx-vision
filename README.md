## Overview

KX-Vision is a powerful Guild Wars 2 addon that enhances your gameplay with real-time information overlays. Track players, enemies, and objects around you with customizable ESP displays. Inspect player gear at a glance, monitor combat performance, and never miss a resource node or vista again. Built using GW2's official MumbleLink API.

## Features

*   **Player ESP:** Track nearby players with customizable filters (friendly, hostile, neutral), gear inspection (3 modes), profession/race/level display.
*   **NPC ESP:** See all enemies and NPCs with rank filtering (legendary, champion, elite, veteran), health tracking, attitude colors.
*   **Object ESP:** Find resource nodes, waypoints, vistas, crafting stations, and 15+ object types with smart filtering.
*   **Real-time Combat Info:** Burst DPS tracking, animated damage numbers, health/energy bars with smooth transitions.
*   **Adaptive Visuals:** Automatic distance-based scaling and fading for clean, uncluttered display.
*   **Flexible Customization:** Per-entity visual controls (boxes, dots, health bars, distance), collapsible detail panels.
*   **Performance Tuning:** Adjustable ESP update rate (15-120 FPS), zero performance impact even in WvW zergs.
*   **Settings Management:** Save/load presets, auto-save on exit, reset to defaults.
*   **MumbleLink Integration:** Utilizes GW2's officially supported MumbleLink API for player and game state data.
*   **Modern UI Design:** Clean, organized ImGui interface with collapsible sections and intuitive controls.
*   **Update Resilient:** Uses pattern scanning to locate game functions, maintaining compatibility across game updates.

## ‚ö° Performance

*   **Zero FPS impact** - even in crowded WvW/meta events
*   **Configurable update rate** - tune 15-120 FPS in settings (default: 60)
*   **Optimized pipeline** - two-stage architecture separates expensive calculations from rendering

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

### Architecture Highlights

This isn't your typical game overlay. KX-Vision demonstrates production-grade patterns rarely seen in open-source game addons:

*   **Crash-proof memory safety** - multi-layer validation (SafeForeignClass, SafeIterators, VirtualQuery caching)
*   **Thread-safe capture system** - stable data extraction from game logic thread
*   **Two-stage rendering pipeline** - throttled calculations + per-frame screen projection
*   **Adaptive far plane** - intelligent scaling based on scene depth
*   **Combat tracking** - burst DPS calculator with smooth animations
*   **Object pooling** - zero heap allocations during rendering for consistent frame times
*   **In-game validation system** - built-in Catch2 tests verify pattern scanning and memory offsets

### Building From Source

**Dual Mode Support:** KX-Vision can be built in two modes:
- **GW2AL Addon Mode:** Integrates with the [Guild Wars 2 Addon Loader](https://github.com/gw2-addon-loader/loader-core) framework for safer, community-supported addon loading.
- **DLL Injection Mode:** A traditional standalone DLL for development and testing.

**Prerequisites:**
*   **Visual Studio:** 2019 or newer
*   **Windows SDK:** 10.0.19041.0 or newer
*   **C++17 Support**

**Build Instructions:**
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kxtools/kx-vision.git
    cd kx-vision
    ```
2.  Open `KX-Vision.sln` in Visual Studio.
3.  Choose your build configuration:
    - **For GW2AL Addon Mode:** `Release-GW2AL | x64`
    - **For DLL Injection Mode:** `Release | x64`
4.  Build the solution (F7 or Build ‚Üí Build Solution).
5.  Find the output DLL in the `x64/Release` or `x64/Release-GW2AL` directory.
