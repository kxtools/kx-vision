**Educational Purpose Only:** This project is developed solely for educational purposes, allowing developers to learn about game rendering concepts, memory manipulation, and MumbleLink API integration in Guild Wars 2.

## Overview

KX-Vision is an open-source ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) overlay for Guild Wars 2. It uses the officially supported MumbleLink API for positional data and is designed as a learning platform for real-time overlay rendering with ImGui and DirectX 11, 3D-to-2D projection, and clean C++ architecture for game tools.

## Features

*   **MumbleLink Integration:** Utilizes GW2's MumbleLink API for player and game state data.
*   **Robust ESP System:** Renders characters (players, NPCs) and objects (resource nodes, waypoints) with comprehensive memory safety.
*   **Crash Prevention:** Advanced memory validation and exception handling for stable operation.
*   **Debug Logging:** Configurable debug output system for troubleshooting and development.
*   **Configurable Visuals:** ESP includes options for boxes, distance, position dots, and health bars.
*   **Minimalist UI:** Clean, organized ImGui interface with collapsible sections.
*   **Patch-Resistant Scanning:** Uses pattern scanning to locate necessary game functions, increasing resilience to game updates.
